##Safe Sound

Safe Sound is an app designed to help people feel safe and be safe. They say there's strength in numbers, and Safe Sound wants to put that idea into action. Especially given the recent sociopolitical climate, many people feel endangered; Safe Sound tries to mitigate this using a three-step safety system.

###Three Steps

**Step 1:** Press the alarm button to toggle an alarm on or off. If there are people around, it will draw attention; assailants generally don't like witnesses, so the unwanted attention should help deter them.

**Step 2:** (PLANNED - UNIMPLEMENTED) If there is no one else around, or if the attacker isn't put off by their attention, then press the "Call an Ally" button to automatically call the nearest registered ally to your location. Start the conversation by letting them know you're a Safe Sound user and feel threatened, then give them information about your situation and attacker. If the attacker knows there's someone out there who can identify them to the police, it should deter them even more.

**Step 3:** If the first two steps fail, or if you feel you are in immediate danger with no time to try them, you can press the Emergency button, which will call for emergency services. In the US, this number is 911, but in other countries, the number varies; Safe Sound will call the appropriate emergency number based on your current location.

###To-Do List

The server end of the Ally system is fully complete. All that's left is to connect the app to the Safe Sound server and add a GPS toggle option (for when you don't want to be tracked), and the app will be ready for its initial realase.

After the initial launch, the following features are planned:

* An Ally rating system. Since Safe Sound does not have the resources to perform background checks on all its registered allies, it provides an Ally Rating feature. After using Safe Sound (which we hope you'll never need to do), the app will remember the last ally called; you can then give them a thumbs up if they helped you, or a thumbs down and a report if you feel they didn't help. Allies with enough negative reports will be checked by Safe Sound employees and, if they fail to be helpful, will be silently blocked from being automatically called by Safe Sound users in the future.
